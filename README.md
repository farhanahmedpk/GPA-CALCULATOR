# 🎓 GPA & CGPA Calculator – SZABIST Grading System

This project is a modern, responsive GPA & CGPA Calculator built specifically around the SZABIST official grading scale. It is designed to help university students accurately calculate their semester GPA and updated CGPA with an intuitive interface and real-time validation.

The calculator allows users to dynamically add multiple courses and input essential academic details such as course credit hours and marks (0–100). Based on the entered marks, the system automatically maps grades and grade points according to the SZABIST grading policy, ensuring accuracy and consistency with official academic standards.

In addition to semester GPA calculation, the tool supports CGPA computation by allowing students to enter their previous CGPA and completed credit hours. The calculator then combines past and current performance to compute an updated cumulative GPA, making it especially useful for tracking long-term academic progress.
